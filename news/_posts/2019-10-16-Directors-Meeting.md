Brett called the meeting to order.

* Brett mentioned that it was time to decide on the ASI Industry Partnership contribution from APSA. In the past we had contributed at the $500 dollar level. Bryce motioned we contribute 500 again, John seconded. Motion passed 5-0.

* There was discussion of the 2018 Membership Meeting. Although only one member called in via phone for the meeting it was decided to continue offering that option.

* The USSES and MARC are starting a project to determine heritability of out-of-season lambing and accelerated lambing. They will be using Polypays and have been acquiring additional industry sheep to use for this study. Itâ€™s likely the first breeding will take place in spring of 2020. MARC is putting up a new lambing barn to support this study.

* The 2020 Membership Meeting was discussed. It was agreed that the Spencer Sale is the event that draws the most PP breeders, so that event is still the best choice currently to get good attendance from the membership. Mark motioned we hold the Annual Membership Meeting at Spencer again in 2020. Bryce seconded. The motion passed 5-0.

Respectfully submitted, <br>
John Anderson, Secretary
