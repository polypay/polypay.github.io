### Committee Reports

* **Sales:** Mark Meurer reported on the questionnaire he had sent out pertaining to having an APSA sale held on it’s own, possibly on-line.  There were 34 responses, 24 yes and 10 no.  Discussion followed.  It was decided 2021 was too early to hold this sale as March was the month considered to be most open.  John motioned to proceed on a March 2022 sale.  Bryce seconded, motion passed 6-0.

* **Youth Committee Report:**  Jeremy is working on a scenario for a youth starter flock program.  A possibility would be two flocks, one NSIP one non NSIP.  Possibly 3 older sheep, one ewe lamb.  Applicants would submit an essay and the winner would be chosen based on that essay.  Kathy said she would send information on how a program she is familiar with in Kansas works.  She mentioned bred ewes the first year with credit toward a ram the second year.  Kathy- APSA could give a partial reimbursement to flocks submitting ewes to the program.  Jeremy is writing up a draft for a program starting in 2022.

* **Advertising Committee Report:** Advertising for 2021 sales has not begun as of February.  Advertising for Sedalia will start in May.
