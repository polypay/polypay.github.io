### New Business
The APSA Annual Meeting will be held July 30 in Spencer Iowa.  Producers will be able to attend remotely.  This year the topic will be the three grants discussed above, and how they could help Polypay producers improve their genetics.


### Old Business
A Polypay producer reported to Mark Meurer that years ago money had been raised to support a Polypay Jr. Show.  This producer suggested that money be made available for a Jr Show in Sedalia. The APSA treasurer found no record of money having been raised for a Jr Show. At the time of this meeting there were no youth registered to show Polypays at the 2021 Midwest Stud Ram Sale.  
A futurity sale was discussed for Sedalia. APSA could hold the money for a futurity sale if youth entered the show in the future.
