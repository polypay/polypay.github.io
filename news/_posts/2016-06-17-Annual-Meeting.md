Glenn Jones went over the financial spreadsheet he developed. He mentioned the directors credits that are outstanding are a bit of a wild card yet. Glenn suggested we buy a certificate with $10,000.00 of the money currently in the account. Glenn thought that starting in January of 2016 and going through the year, we should be able to get an idea of the future financial health of APSA. Currently we have enough reserves.

**Committees for 2016-2017**
* Sale committee - Bryce, Chris, Mark and Todd Taylor.
* Finance committee - all board members
* Advertising committee -Brett, Mark, John Anderson
* By laws committee - Glenn, Chris Kaeb, Chris Schauer, Jeremy and Bryce
