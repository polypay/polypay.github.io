They want our breed’s input on several topics including creating new polypay lines to regain hybrid vigor, wool, optimizing weaning rates in range sheep, and working to get their records on NSIP.  Let Brett know any other topics you would like him to discuss while he is there.  The board also is planning a conference call with the Sheep Experimental Station research leader, Dr. Bret Taylor at some point.
