Bryce said that the lawyer working on the paperwork for moving the Association from Colorado to Minnesota will probably cost about $900 to $1,000 dollars.

A discussion was held on the merits of changing the name of our breed registry from American Polypay Sheep Association to American Polypay Sheep Registry.  This renaming would smooth a possible change in our tax status.  John Anderson motioned that that the last word in the name be changed from Association to Registry, Chris Kaeb seconded.  The motion passed 8-0.

A discussion was held on allowing non-members to place “sheep wanted” advertisements on the website for free.  This is a service to members as it helps promote the breed.  Producers wishing to sell sheep still need to join the Registry in order to place the ads.  Brett Pharo made the motion to allow non-members to place “sheep wanted” ads on the website, Chris Kaeb seconded.  The motion passed 8-0.

Respectfully submitted

John Anderson

Secretary
