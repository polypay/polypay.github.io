We are in our third and final year of the grant from the Let’s Grow Committee to work on quantitative genetic analysis of parasite resistance and the collection of DNA samples for possible future genome research. Though they are not a serious problem in every region or in every operation, parasites and their developing resistance to anthelmintics are a major concern for the sheep industry in the United States. Genetic resistance to parasites is highly heritable, and Polypays are the first wool breed to work toward identifying animals with superior genetics for resistance. This has not gone unnoticed in the industry.  


With this summer being the final year of our grant to cover most of the costs of doing the FEC’s, consider participating whether you’ve participated in the past or not.  Let Chris Schauer know approximately how many samples you expect you will have. Mailer boxes and blood cards will be available for pick up at our annual membership meeting in Spencer, IA the last weekend of this month. If you are planning to participate but won’t be at the meeting, let Jerry Sorensen or Chris know.
