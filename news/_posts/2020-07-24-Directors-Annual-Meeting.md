#### Annual Membership Meeting

Brett called the meeting to order.

Brett mentioned that Sedalia, Spencer and several other sales were canceled for 2020.  There was a discussion about the 2020 online sale for NSIP sheep.  That sale was run by Willoughby Livestock Sales and was held on July 8, 2020.  Most agreed the Polypay sheep sold well.

A discussion followed on possible sales in 2021.  There could be 4 or more significant sales with Polypay Sheep held both online and on location.

Bill Hardman mentioned perhaps all the APSA board meetings could be held via Zoom to help members stay in touch.  There was also a suggestion to have the 2021 Annual Meeting and National Sale held via Zoom.  Zoom might make it possible for membership to hear the invited speakers and see any presentations.  In 2019 members could call in to hear the meeting via conference call, although there were not many people who tried that option.

Chris Kaeb reported APSA is on solid financial footing and asked if there are other services we can offer members. One suggestion was to organize another starter flock program.  In the past APSA offered money to go toward buying a with members donating ewes.  Caroline Scheffert suggested offering scholarships toward starter flocks.  The observation was made that in years past some of the starter flock recipients did not keep their flocks very long.  A suggestion was made to offer starter flocks to older youth with more resources.  In years past APSA considered starter flocks for ages 9-18.  There were suggestions that if this program was re-started it might be targeted toward 15-25 year old members.

John Carlson mentioned a grant could help breeders get involved in genotyping.  Perhaps APSA could offer matching funds for such a grant.  There was agreement that we should be open to helping with a genotyping study involving PP sheep.

Another idea was to get the Association more involved in finding mentors for new producers.  One thought was to have the APSA assign volunteer mentors to any producer seeking help.

The 2020 National Meeting was adjourned at 8:47 Central Time.
