**D. Let’s Grow Grant:** Chris briefed the board on the funding that was granted for the FEC project through Let’s Grow. Moved by Glen to accept the grant $, 2nd by Jeremy. Passed unanimously.
* FEC Project Committee: Chaired by Chris Schauer
* Committee: Jerry Sorrenson, John Anderson (?), Diane Hermann (?) Billed: to Chris Schauer’s address

**E. NSIP #’s on Registration certificate:** Glen briefed the board on being able to use the NSIP 16 digit # as the registration # for the registry. Jeff at Associated Registries indicated it is possible to do it; NSIP breeders would have a 16 digit registration # that was the same as their NSIP #, non-NSIP breeders would continue to have the traditional registration #.

**F. Colorado Address:** We need to have a physical address in Colorado. Currently, Bill Hardman fulfills that need, but we maybe need to look for a replacement. There is only 1 other breeder in CO at this time.

Meeting adjourned at 7:40 pm (MT).
