Kathy has been looking into genomic testing and how we might use this
tool to improve the breed. In order to be truly helpful, there would
need to be a substantial breed specific project. Polypay producers would
need to determine the traits we would like to find markers for like
growth, health, fertility, parasite resistance etc.

John made a motion to have Kathy continue to investigate how we might
implement genomic testing in the Polypay breed. Mark seconded and the
motion passed 5-0.

Due to a producer inquiry there was a short discussion on using
registered PP rams to breed non registered commercial PP ewes up to F-4
status so they could be registered. Currently the APSA by-laws do not
allow this.

Mark Van Roekel moved to adjourn the meeting. Kathy seconded, the motion
passed 5-0.

John Anderson, Secretary
