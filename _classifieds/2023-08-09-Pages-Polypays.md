Polypay Rams. These yearling rams are all twins or triplets except for one. We have been in the Polypay business for 30 plus years. The last ewes added to our flock were 8 ewe lambs from the US Sheep Experiment Station, Dubois, Idaho 2002. Most of our rams came from there too. Our ewes lamb at about 240%+ and this year our ewe lambs (12 to 14 months old) lambed at 160%+.

Our Polypays are raised mostly on grass. The rams have not been creep fed. These rams are not being fed grain. If we do not answer and we will get back to you. To many spam calls!! Polypays are Awesome!!! See us on Facebook at Page Ranch Registered Polypay Sheep!!
