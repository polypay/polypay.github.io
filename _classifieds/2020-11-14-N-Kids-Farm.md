We value maternal characteristics and early fertility. This ram lamb was born and raised as a twin in early June 2020. In addition to introducing great mothering genetics to your flock (Maternal Index 115.4), this ram will also provide great post weaning weight EBVs. You'll get great growth from these lambs' offspring once they're off their moms. This ram and their moms have never needed to be dewormed. Our flock has tested 100% negative for OPP.
