Two sets of ewe lambs for sale. Six born in January 2018 and five born in May 2018. All should be ready to be bred for 2019 lambs. Two of these are 100% and the others are 50, 75, or 87% Polypay genetics. We value maternal characteristics and early fertility. In addition to great mothering genetics, these ewe lambs are daughters of rams that have great post weaning weight EBVs so you'll get great growth from these lambs' offspring once they're off their moms. Lambs and their moms have never been dewormed. Our flock has tested 100% negative for OPP.
