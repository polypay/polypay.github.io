Several ram lambs born in January 2019 are available for sale at $600 each. They each have maternal indices between 111 and 113.  
<br>
We value maternal characteristics and early fertility. In addition to introducing great mothering genetics to your flock, these rams will also provide great post weaning weight EBVs. You'll get great growth from these lambs' offspring once they're off their moms. These rams and their moms have never needed to be dewormed. Our flock has tested 100% negative for OPP.
