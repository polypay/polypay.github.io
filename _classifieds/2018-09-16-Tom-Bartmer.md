We have beautiful Polypay ram lambs for sale. Born January-March 2018. Registered with the American Polypay Sheep Association. $150. These will make excellent breeders, and we're hoping we can find them a good home. Most are from multiple births (twins, triplets). At this time, we're only interested in selling to those who want to breed them or add to existing flocks. We have one multi-colored ram lamb ("Smokey") - a real winner.  We can deliver if you're not too far away.
