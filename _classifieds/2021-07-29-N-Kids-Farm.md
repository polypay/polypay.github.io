We value maternal characteristics and early fertility. These ram lambs were born in January 2021 both were triplets and one was raised as a triplet (21009) and the other as a twin (21026). In addition to introducing great mothering genetics to your flock (both Maternal Indices 114), these rams will also provide great post weaning weight EBVs. You'll get great growth from these lambs' offspring once they're off their moms. These ram and their moms have never needed to be dewormed. Our flock has tested 100% negative for OPP.
